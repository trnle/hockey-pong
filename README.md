# Hockey Pong

A 2D two-player game of pong or air hockey. Two paddles are on each side of the table screen and a ball bounces back and forth across a white net. If the ball hits either side of the screen ends, a point is accounted for at the top of the screen. The game continuously plays until the user clicks or exits out of the game.
